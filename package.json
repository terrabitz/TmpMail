  "description": "This is a simple self-hosted disposable mail application built on Python. There are several proprietary solutions out there, but any paid service tends to be more expensive than it's worth, and any free service will typically not  allow custom domains. This project is light enough to be hosted on a single Docker container and run with custom domains.",
