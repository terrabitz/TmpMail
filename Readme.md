# TmpMail

This is a simple self-hosted disposable mail application built on Python. There
are several proprietary solutions out there, but any paid service tends to be
more expensive than it's worth, and any free service will typically not 
allow custom domains. This project is light enough to be hosted on a single Docker
container and run with custom domains.
